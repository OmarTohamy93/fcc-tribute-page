                <ul>
                    <li><span>Zaynab bint Maz'un,</span> she was the mother of Hafsa, Abd Allah and Abd al-Rahman
                        al-Akbar</li>
                    <li><span>Umm Kulthum bint Jarwal,</span> she was divorced by Umar. She was the mother of Ubayd
                        Allah and Zayd
                        al-Asgha</li>
                    <li><span>Qurayba bint Abi Umayya,</span> divorced by Umar in 628</li>
                    <li><span>Jamila bint Thabit,</span> she married Umar sometime between May 627 and May 628 They had
                        one son, Asim
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Atiqa bint Zayd,</span> she was married to Umar and had a son named Iyad</li>
                    <li><span>Umm Hakim bint al-Harith ibn Hisham,</span> she was married to Umar in 634 and was mother
                        of Fatima.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Umm Kulthum bint Ali</span> from this marriage Umar had a son named Zayd and a daughter
                        named Ruqayya.
                        This
                        is, however, the Sunni view. The Shi'a do not accept that such a marriage took place. In fact,
                        even
                        some Sunni scholars maintain that Umar's wife Umm Kulthum was actually Abu Bakr's daughter who
                        was
                        raised in Ali's house.</li>
